# grammY guard bot

This bot protects [@grammyjs](https://t.me/grammyjs) from too many crypto spammers.

As of October 2024, we see ~150 scams per week.
That is too annoying for admins to moderate manually, so we have built this bot as a first layer of protection.
We may reevaluate and eventually discontinue its usage once the numbers go down again.

Please do not copy our idea.
If you have to copy our idea, please implement it slightly differently.
That way, you are not making it more attractive for scammers to build an automated solution to break this captcha.
Not only will you help protect @grammyjsâ€”your own chat will be safer, too.
Thank you!

# grammY guard bot

This bot protects [@grammyjs](https://t.me/grammyjs) from too many crypto spammers.

As of October 2024, we see ~150 scams per week.
That is too annoying for admins to moderate manually, so we have built this bot as a first layer of protection.
We may reevaluate and eventually discontinue its usage once the numbers go down again.
